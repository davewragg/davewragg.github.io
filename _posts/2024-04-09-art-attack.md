A little while ago I asked the phenomenally talented (and multi-award winning) writer and artist **[Jen Williams](https://www.sennydreadful.co.uk/)** to knock up a picture of Ree and Javani, and now, in anticipation of the **paperback release of The Hunters (coming 4th July)**, you can see the results. I am, as you can imagine, absolutely delighted, and I hope we'll be seeing more of Jen's art around here before long.

In the meantime, if you'd like to commission Jen yourself, you can get in touch [on her website](https://www.sennydreadful.co.uk/contact).

More news to follow on the (different?!) paperback cover, as well as a title and cover reveal for Book 2 - watch this space, or [join my mailing list](http://eepurl.com/gBvwHH) to be the first to hear when things eventually happen!
