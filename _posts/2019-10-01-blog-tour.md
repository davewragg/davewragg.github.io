Release week is upon us at last - the book will be released in two days, on Thursday 3rd October. I hope you've all got your pre-orders in.

To celebrate the release, we're doing a blog tour this week - visiting some of our favourite book websites with some Q&As, extracts and guest features. Here's the programme:

The first couple of features are already up at [Civilian Reader](https://civilianreader.com/2019/09/30/interview-with-david-wragg/), and [EspressoCoco](https://espressococo.com/2019/10/01/the-black-hawks-david-wragg/). We'll be following up tomorrow with [Ebookwyrm's BlogCave](http://ebookwyrm.blogspot.com/), [The Bibliophile Chronicles](https://thebibliophilechronicles.com) on launch day itself, [ReaderDad](https://readerdad.co.uk) on Friday and [SF and F Reviews](https://sfandfreviews.blogspot.com) on Saturday.

And in case you missed it, Fantasy Hive previously blessed us with an [Author Spotlight](https://fantasy-hive.co.uk/2019/09/author-spotlight-david-wragg/) and an [exclusive extract](https://fantasy-hive.co.uk/2019/09/the-black-hawks-by-david-wragg-excerpt/) from the book.

Roll on Thursday!
