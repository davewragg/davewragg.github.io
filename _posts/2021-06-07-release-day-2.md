## The long road

It's release day. Later than planned (much, _much_ later) but we got there in the end. As you read these words, **The Righteous** is loose in the world. Below you'll find a list of all the pre-release, release and post-release coverage, which is all very exciting indeed.

## Over to you

That's about all I can do from here (although do check back now and again to see new content as it arrives). As and when you get to the book, I hope it delights you. And if you fancy leaving a review on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0008331448/) or [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50174451-the-righteous), you'll be keeping the machine turning just a little bit longer.

Cheers x
