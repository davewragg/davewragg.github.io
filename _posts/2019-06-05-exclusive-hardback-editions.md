The superheroes at [Goldsboro Books](https://www.goldsborobooks.com/) have got their hands on a strictly limited and numbered set of **Exclusive Hardback Editions** of the Black Hawks, complete with **sprayed edges**, and are now offering them for pre-order. You'd have to be an absolute monster to miss out on this, and we know you're not monsters. Not even you, Colin.

Get thee to the [Product Page](https://www.goldsborobooks.com/product/the-black-hawks-exclusive-hardback-edition) forthwith and get your order in - this is a rare treat and, unlike Channel 4's morning schedule*, will never be repeated.

It says here they'll be signed by the author, but try not to let that put you off.
