> _The Righteous_ in its final form stuck with Chel's POV for the duration, but in the original draft we saw a number of scenes from the POV of other members of the Black Hawks. In the middle part of the book, with the group split up, our heroes attempted to find allies for their coming battle against the forces of the crown.
>
> In this section, Rennic is forced (at Chel's insistence) to investigate a possible hideout of his old mentor, the feared Butcher of the Red Hand, in the vague hope that his old comrades might join their forces.

Rennic watched the trees. They were close on either side, wet and looming.

'This is a stupid, stupid idea.'

The boy walked ahead of him, long strides up the hill, flaunting his endurance. 'It's as sensible as anything else we've tried.'

The trail wound up through the thick woods, narrow and blind. He lost count of possible ambush sites in no time. 'You don't know what's up here. This could be our deaths.'

The boy stopped, turned, condescension ruffling his taut brow. 'It's not like you to be so fearful, old man.'

Rennic felt the anger flare within him, controlled it, breathed it out like dragonfire.

'You know very little, small man. You think we'll find the remnants of the Hand up here?'

He resumed his climb. 'That poor sap from Qazvizd tracked the Butcher of the Hand to this area, to a tree-house by a lake. This could be the place.'

'And then what? What do you think will happen if you're right?'

The boy shrugged, maddening. 'You rode with them. Just use a bit of that Rennic charm, tell some old war stories, remind them of how good you were together. Then they can ride to our aid.'

'We were not good together.'

'Is that how they remember it?'

Rennic snarled. 'What do I care? It's been the better part of your lifetime since I saw any of them, assuming they still live, assuming they're here at all.'

'Then you'll have a lot to catch up on.'

'Why are you insisting on this?'

'Why are you so afraid of it?'

Rennic stood, one hand opening and closing, boots clumped with fresh hill mud. When he spoke, his voice seemed very small.

'Why do you think?'

He heard the draw of a bowstring over the soft patter of dripping foliage and knew immediately that they were done. He dropped his staff and raised his hands, slowly.

'We mean no harm. You can come out.'

The boy looked around in shock and fear, and he felt a fleeting surge of satisfaction.

A face appeared from the shifting wall of green to their right, slack and hollow-cheeked. 'Who are you and what is your business on this hill? Speak quickly, a dozen arrows have you marked.' The voice was deep but ragged, frayed by age.

Rennic peered into the bobbing foliage. 'Crake, is that you?'

The dark sockets peered back. 'Tadpole Rennic?'

The boy was grinning. 'This is a good sign, wouldn't you say?'

'Shut up,' Rennic muttered, and took a cautious step forward.

---

The stockade was tall, well-built and maintained, towers well-spaced, guards both visible and invisible. Earthworks and stakes lay before the walls, and Rennic saw evidence of stone block-work at their foot, a precaution against undermining. They might be on top of a hill in the middle of a forest in next-to-nowhere, but the occupants of the timber-house were taking no chances.

Crake and three others, young, strutting types he didn't recognise, led them the rest of the way. Crake had always seemed old to him, a tall, looming presence, short hair streaked silver and lines around his eyes. Now he was something else, his spine bent, hair thinned and silvered, those lines deepened and reinforced. Before he had seemed old. Now he was old. He made limited conversation as they climbed, his breath coming heavy from the exertion, unwilling to show the toll by speaking. Rennic was grateful; they'd had little enough to talk about two decades before, and the burning in his own thighs was nothing he wished to advertise.

The gate was doubled, of course, a space between the two gates to trap invaders and perforate them. Rennic wondered if the boy was taking it in, was aware of the perfection of the fortifications around them. He seemed so nonchalant, so unfazed by their surroundings. Rennic wanted to grab him, shake him and scream into his face. If what remained of the Hand were truly here, if the Silence were here, the chances of them walking back out of these gates were vanishingly small. How could the boy be so fucking oblivious?

Crake left them with the young turks and shuffled off into the interior, his bow over his shoulder. The hill plateaued then sloped down away from the walls, terminating in an escarpment overlooking the silvery lake below. The buildings within the stockade did not match his expectations. Instead of ordered rows of barracks, blacksmiths, stables, latrines and administration, he saw a higgledy-piggledy clutch of buildings, some stone-walled, others wood or cob. There seemed little order to their layout he could discern, although he could at least spot the latrines. A wider, taller structure occupied the centre of the stockade, twists of smoke rising from twin chimneys. Rennic realised that he'd been looking at the place as a camp, something temporary, but everywhere he looked he saw evidence of permanence. High voices tinkled from somewhere downslope. Could that be… children?

Crake returned, sunken features looking no better in the anaemic afternoon light.

'Come.'

---

A beast of a man, bald and thickly bearded, met them at the wide door of the largest building, nodded away Crake then glared at the two new arrivals. Rennic had an inch or two on him in height, but the man was as wide as Foss, stout and muscled, a great gut jutting beneath the beef of his chest. He stared at Rennic as if he recognised him, black brows thunderous low, then at the boy with greater suspicion. Rennic stared back, trying to place him, but his age was hard to judge. Time ran a different course over everyone.

Beneath the swooping beams inside, a figure sat slurping from a wide wooden bowl by an open hearth. He looked up, saw Rennic and waved a hand, and the bearded beast allowed them entry.

It took Rennic a moment to place the man on the wooden stool beside the fire. He was larger, saggier, his features exaggerated by age. Rennic felt revulsion at seeing the folded chins jostling beneath unfamiliar jowls, the wild wisps of hair that rose from his sweat-sheened pate. The ponytail remained, diminished but hanging as proud as ever down his broad back.

'Buresse. You look… still alive.'

The man rose, a broad grin splitting his suddenly-but-not-suddenly fleshy features. 'Tadpole Rennic! Eastern Eagle! My boy, look at you!'

He moved in a flash, the punch coming hard from the hip. Rennic had only a heartbeat to react, to tense and turn, absorbing the blow with little more than a grunt. He rocked back on his toes, ignoring the bloom of pain from his midriff. Buresse grinned wider.

'You can still move, eh, you big-nosed twat.'

Rennic breathed long from his nose. The boy was watching everything with habitual intent. 'So can you, I see.'

Buresse chuckled. 'Might have lost half-a-yard since we last rode, Tadpole, but some things stay with you. Why are you here? How did you find us? Who's the turd?' The questions rattled off like a volley.

'Just lucky.' Rennic nodded to the boy. 'This is Chel. Apprentice.'

'Learning from you, is he, Tad? My boy, you are so fucked you have no idea.'

The boy looked back, eyes narrow.

'He doesn't like being called 'boy',' Rennic said with malicious intent. Buresse's smile was predatory.

'That a fact?'

The boy was unfazed. Rennic felt a little flare of pride at the disdain on his face. 'This is the famous Butcher of the Red Hand? The Crimson Grief?'

The two men looked at each other then erupted in laughter.

'Oh ho ho fuck me, no,' Buresse said. He jerked a thumb towards the room's far end, where a wide doorway led onto a railed wooden terrace, projecting out over the slope. 'Outside.'

'See you later, Buresse.'

The boy went to follow, but Buresse laid a meaty hand on his chest. Age might have bloated and wilted him, but the murderous strength remained. 'Just Tad, for now.'

Rennic met the boy's questioning stare with a nod, which he aimed to keep confident. Inside parts of him had started to flutter, a strange, giddy feeling he despised.

'Out there?' He jerked his head, not daring to gesture lest Buresse see the trembling in his fingers.

'Out there. I'll mind your boy.'

One more stare, hard, uncompromising.

'See that you don't.'

Rennic walked from the room and out onto the terrace, fire creeping from his belly.

---

The sound of voices drew him around the building's dappled, curving wall, stepping carefully through the rail's long slanting shadows. The creaks of the boards announced his approach a mile off, but somehow it seemed important to minimise the effects of his presence. One cautious hand on the wall, he rounded the corner, almost too overcome to look directly. There, in a high-backed wooden chair in the pallid afternoon sun, with an enraptured little girl perched on a woven lap-blanket, sat the Silence, the Crimson Grief, the Butcher of the Red Hand.

She looked exactly the same.

The silver strands in her hair had multiplied, her mane thinner and more silver than dark, and deep lines wrapped her eyes and mouth, the long scars on her cheek seeming graver than he remembered. But the strength remained, the purpose, the terrible clarity of her black eyes, now turned towards the child perched on her knee. She was recounting a tale of a haughty frog, her voice the same throaty iron he remembered, perhaps deepened, loosened by age, or perhaps unfamiliar with the affection she directed to the girl. Already his memories of her were shifting, melding with the scene before him, and he found himself unable to remember exactly how her hair had fallen if not like this, how she had held her hands. How she had held a sword.

She made no move to acknowledge him, although it was impossible she was unaware of his presence, so he waited, leaning against the wall in what he hoped passed for repose, fighting the trembling in his legs and fingers, while the tale of the haughty frog concluded. The frog returned, at last, in triumph to his lily pad, but he was an older, wiser frog, more humble, and he vowed to change his ways for the better.

The little girl beamed at the story's conclusion, then was dispatched with an affectionate ruffle. The girl jumped down and bounded past Rennic without a look, as if strange armed men were ten-a-copper around her. He supposed that perhaps they were.

Then they were alone, the woman in the chair gazing at the setting sun over the lake and the wooded hills, the man at the wall in shadow. Rennic hesitated, tried to speak, found his throat too thick for words.

She spoke for him.

'Forgive me if I don't get up, Garrett. Are you still going by that name?'

He found his voice. 'Sometimes.'

'I didn't think I'd see you again.'

'Nor did I.'

'Yet here you are.'

'I am.'

She said nothing more, and he shifted in discomfort during the silence. At last he said, 'How are you?'

She laughed, once, then turned to face him. The evening sun on her face marked the passage of time in vivid relief, every pit, crease and scar carved deep into the suffering skin.

'I live, Gar. Shepherd's grace. And you? You look healthy. I like the beard. Are you working?'

'More often than not.'

'Good. Good. Although the tales we hear, bad business out there. This Nort witchfire… if any robed peasant with devil's alchemy can rip a hole in a fighting force, who's going to drop coin for professionals? Wouldn't surprise me if those red bastards were keeping a tight seal on it all, another year or two of this and the market ends as we know it. No paying work but guarding a farmer's sty.' She sucked at her teeth, and for a moment she was twenty years younger in his vision, astride a champing mount on a hilltop, contemplating a forthcoming massacre.

He stepped out of the shadows, approaching the rail by her side. 'That's related to why I'm here.'

She raised a thinning eyebrow. 'If you've come for fighting bodies, I'm afraid you'll leave disappointed.'

A leaden lurch, his mouth already sour. 'What do you mean? Are you short of men? The camp looks well-staffed.'

'Camp?'

He waved a hand at the stockade around them, the mashed buildings beneath the terrace. 'This place, this compound.'

'This, Gar, is a home.'

'If you like.'

'No, Gar, you misunderstand. This is a safe place, a place for family, out of the way. Safe from harm.'

'What are you talking about? I just saw Buresse, are you calling him family?'

'He's been with me all the time you haven't.'

Stung by her words, his teeth bared. 'What is this? You've… You've gone soft? The Butcher, The Reaver of Smiles, reading stories to children in her dotage behind high walls?'

Her eyes were very wide. 'You forget yourself, Garrett. How old are you, now? Two-score? You can't be far away.'

'And?'

'You think you can go on forever? You think you can keep doing this, beating back those younger, hungrier? Mark me, you'll be gutted by a clean-cheeked youth before your hair turns. Everyone thinks they're different, until time's millstone drags them under. You can't fight your age, Gar.'

'_You_ were always the one looking for something to die for. That's what you said, wasn't it? 'Find a cause worth dying for, but until then, keep living and keep earning'.'

'I did say that.'

'What changed?'

'What changed?' She pulled back the blanket from her knees, revealing wizened, stick-thin legs beneath. 'This.'

Rennic stared at her ruined legs in incomprehension. 'What… What happened?'

She shook her head, teeth gritted. 'Never lost a battle, never picked a losing side. Now my own body eats me from within. I've not walked these past two winters. No idea if I'll see another two.'

'Plague?'

'Not any I've ever seen. Something inside. Moves slow, but never gives ground.' She smiled, dark and mirthless. 'Crake says maybe it's the past.'

Rennic shook his head. 'This is horseshit, a setback. You'll get through it, you've never—'

'Everyone thinks they're different, Gar. Nobody is.'

He stood in silence, trying to find anything else to stare at beyond her shrunken legs. Soft birds wheeled overhead, black stripes against the buttery sky.

'Why are you here, Gar?'

It was easier to talk when he was looking away, over the lake. 'Rose has claimed the church at last, looking to resurrect the Empire. They've bloated the Thorn with steel and alchemy, and they're marching south, meaning to swallow the remaining companies and crush the last of the territories.'

'And where do you fit in to this? No coin in this new-modelled army?'

'Not that kind of outfit.' He watched the dying sunlight glimmer on the lake's surface, a column of twinkling points of light beneath the disc of copper fire melting into the trees on the far shore. 'We're organising to fight them.'

'We?'

'New king's brother, some of the tribal folk, the sensible companies, a couple of sympathetic Names and foreign agents.'

'Impressive collection. What's the end goal?'

He flexed his fingers against the rail. He was close to her now, close enough to notice the way she held one arm, loose against her body, fingers curled. Her sword arm.

'Total overthrow. Rout the confessors in the south, destroy the church hierarchy, depose the king for his brother. Ensure nothing like this happens again.'

'And reap rewards?'

He shrugged.

'Eventually.'

She looked at him sidelong, blood-faced in the light of the sunset. 'Gar, I do believe you've found a cause. Worth dying for?'

'Hope not to find out.'

'And you came here to bolster your ranks.'

'Something like that.'

'Sorry you had a wasted trip. Nice to see you're still going, though, for now at least.'

He was on one knee beside her before he was even aware of it, taking her idle hand in his.

'This isn't over.' The words were fast, hot in his throat. 'You're not gone yet. You're still a symbol, and even… like this… you can still ride. Hell, fellow with no legs rode with the Keys, they just strapped him to his mule and set him swinging.' He was looking into her deep black eyes, the fire of lakelight shining back in them. 'Ride with us. One last time. Raise a sword, lead a charge, do some good. Go out fighting, not a cripple in a chair, withering, decaying.'

He thought she was with him, then, thought she was aboard, from the look of profound understanding in those black eyes. 'Oh Gar,' she said. 'You must be mad.'

Her look was pity. Heat prickled at his nape.

'What? Why not?'

'You've seen where I spend my days, where I'll live out what I have left. I'm away from the world, surrounded by family and dear old friends, keeping those I love safe.'

'Family? _Family?_'

'You saw my boy on the way in, and his daughter, my story-time companion.'

The bald, bearded brute. '_That_ was Little Pel?'

'Not so little these days. My girl is here too, you may not have known her. I have seven grandchildren, so far.' Her voice was level, but he could see the pride in her eyes. 'And I intend to see as much of their lives as I can before I go.'

Rage was climbing from within him, long claws digging a path up his gullet.

'I was right. The Butcher of the Red Hand wants her dotage after all.'

'Listen, Gar, if you make it to my—'

_Liar. Hypocrite. Coward._

'Liar! Hypocrite! Coward!' He was looming over her, fists clenching and unclenching, hand creeping instinctively towards his belt. 'I watched you murder entire families, generations at a stroke! I watched you burn villages, hang children! I stood beside you when you ordered the deaths of hundreds of blameless people for little more than a handful of coin or an afternoon's entertainment. I was complicit!'

She watched him through narrowed eyes, motionless. Whether she was unable or unwilling to move it was uncertain.

'I know this, Gar.'

'You were… You _are_ a fucking monster! Monsters don't get to live out their days in peace by a lake, telling fucking stories to their fucking grand-children!' He stepped away, hands wild, then stepped back. 'I have been dogged, _haunted_ by the things we did for the best part of two decades, half of my life. You know how we found you? Remember Qazvizd?' He didn't wait for her acknowledgement. 'Some poor fucker, some kid who survived what we did by drinking his own piss and eating the dead, made it his life's mission to hunt us all down, make us atone. Caught up with me, and you know what?'

'You killed him.'

'Of course I fucking did. What else was I going to do? What else was I made to do?'

'And now you're thinking you should have let him make you atone? The rest of us, too?'

'Yes! No! But, Shepherd's _fuck_, this can't be right. You know this can't be right. How can you sit there and tell me you deserve peace?'

She raised her uncurled hand. 'I can't. I don't deserve it, I know that. It doesn't stop me wanting it though. It doesn't stop me wanting all this.' She looked around the stockade, then indicated her stricken legs. 'Maybe Crake is right, maybe this is the past catching up with me, taking me piece by piece.'

'It's not enough. Not for what you've done.'

'I know, Gar. But I have no excuses. I was wrong.'

'You were wrong.' His tone was too dead to make it a question.

'I was. About everything. About what mattered.'

'So ride with us! Atone!'

She shook her head. 'All that time trying to find something to die for. We should have been looking for something to live for.'

The knife was already in his hand. She met his gaze with the same black contempt she'd always kept behind it all.

'Are you going to make me atone, Gar Rennic?'

He breathed long and hard through his nose, tamping down the rage, tempering it with cold air.

'Fuck you, Yana. For everything. May your death be long and painful.'

He turned a strode away, feeling the creak of the boards beneath his boots, feeling the burn of her gaze into his back.

'It's not too late for you, Gar,' she called after him. 'Cleave to your cause. Change your course. You might even outlive me.'
