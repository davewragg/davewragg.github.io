T﻿here are, to put it mildly, a fair few connections between my first series (The Black Hawks and The Righteous) and the Tales of the Plains, especially The Hunters. Some of them are fairly significant, lots are utterly trivial, and a fair few you wouldn't even know as the linking material in question was edited out along the way. Soz.

## Spoilers below 

N﻿eedless to say, the rest of this post contains spoilers for both Articles of Faith books **and** The Hunters, so please only continue if you've read the lot (or are just past caring).

### Ree is Loveless

Y﻿ou probably guessed that one. It's been 13 years since she rode off in The Righteous, she's stopped dying her hair, but she's still carrying around her sword and one of Kosh's prototype crossbows.
