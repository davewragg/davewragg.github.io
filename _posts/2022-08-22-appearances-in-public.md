After a year or two of living in a cave (metaphorically speaking), I'll be venturing forth for not one but TWO conventions in the next couple of months. If you'd like to witness me in the flesh, or the closest approximation of it, I'll be at both [FantasyCon](https://www.britishfantasysociety.org/category/fantasycon/) and [BristolCon](https://www.bristolcon.org/) this year.

**FantasyCon** is taking place on the 17th and 18th September at the Heathrow Radisson Red Hotel, and my schedule there is as follows:

| Day           | Time  | Panel/Reading    | Location |
|---------------|-------|------------------|----------|
| Saturday 17/9 | 11:00 | Writing Humour   | Room 2   |
| Saturday 17/9 | 14:00 | Writing Dialogue | Room 4   |
| Sunday 18/9   | 13:00 | Reading          | Room 5   |

The full schedule is available on [the BFS website](https://www.britishfantasysociety.org/fantasycon/fantasycon-programme/) - do come along if you're in the neighbourhood, especially as I will be reading from **SOMETHING NEW AND UNANNOUNCED**.

**BristolCon** will be at the Hilton DoubleTree Hotel in Bristol on Saturday 29th October. The schedule is yet to be announced, but do keep an eye on [their website](https://www.bristolcon.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=17) for more details.

And, as I've been saying for months (years?), I'm sure I'll have some meaningful news soon, so once again, watch this space. In the meantime, I hope to see you at one of the conventions!
