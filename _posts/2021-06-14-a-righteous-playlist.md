You may remember that The Black Hawks [has its own soundtrack](https://www.davewragg.com/blog/musical-interlude/), care of mellifluous composer Will Musser. As yet, The Righteous doesn't have one of its own, so I thought in the style of [Nicholas Eames](https://nicholaseames.com/soundtrack/) (and others) I'd assemble a playlist of thematic tracks to go along with the book. Because I am an ancient prat, they are all from Iron Maiden.

Of course, in terms of the book's message, you can't do a lot better than Garbage's stellar new album [No Gods, No Masters](https://open.spotify.com/album/1oLs7LqGqSmD643CULAiZc) which came out a day or two after the book. But let's pretend otherwise, shall we?
