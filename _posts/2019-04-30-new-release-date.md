The good news: Black Hawks manuscript has gone for copy-editing, so we're nearly there. However, we're going to be delaying release to October to make sure the book is as absolutely spiffing as possible. The new release date I have listed is __3rd October__. Pre-orderers (thank you!) should already have had an email to that effect.

I'm sorry to be delaying the release, but it's worth it to make sure the book is the best it can be when it gets out there. And now you have something to look forward to when the nights start drawing in.

I'd have been on this news a bit faster but was in Cuba for a wedding - congratulations again to Carolina and Charlie!
