**T﻿he Hunters** arrives this Thursday, 20th July. There's an action-packed release week schedule, but for now I thought I'd get together a few links you might have missed from the last few weeks, then I can add to them as we go. (I often say I'm going to come back and update posts, and one day I might even do it.)

## Interviews

- Mega-author and best bud Anna Stephens was kind enough to host me on her website for [an interview](https://anna-stephens.com/2023/05/21/author-interview-david-wragg-on-the-hunters/), where I dug into where the new book has come from and where the series is going.

## Reviews

- Nils at the Fantasy Hive has posted an exclusive (and glowing) [early review](https://fantasy-hive.co.uk/2023/05/the-hunters-by-david-wragg-book-review/). Five stars, would hunt again.


- A﻿nd the Fantasy Hive liked it so much, they reviewed it a second time! Thanks to Beth for [this magnificent 5-starrer](https://fantasy-hive.co.uk/2023/06/the-hunters-by-david-wragg-book-review-2/)

## Podcasts


- I﻿ was lucky enough to be invited onto the Tiny Bookcase podcast, and enjoyed reading a short story in the [first episode](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1129067/13145828-134-bitching-with-dave-wragg) and a wide-ranging, ludicrous chat in the [second episode](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1129067/13177966).
