> _The Righteous_ in its final form stuck with Chel's POV for the duration, but in the original draft we saw a number of scenes from the POV of other members of the Black Hawks. In the middle part of the book, with the group split up, our heroes attempted to find allies for their coming battle against the forces of the crown.
>
> In this section, Foss and Loveless attempt to convince an excitable but powerful nobleman to join their forces.

Foss watched Loveless preen before gleaming polished bronze disc that hung from the chapel wall, its perimeter etched and florid. She readjusted her newly recoloured hair, the open neck of her new shirt, the great blue stone in its silver setting that sat there. An energetic two-handed motion shifted her chest to a position that satisfied her. Foss sighed.

'Don't sigh at me, Brother Fossington. You want this to go well, right? Shirin is notorious for two things, and if we want one we need to offer the other.'

'Why do we even still have that ridiculous bauble? We need the coin for a dozen other things.'

'Because it will do a job that few other things will. If this doesn't work, don't you worry. I'll be cashing it at the first opportunity. Maybe we can get you a horse big enough to ride then, eh?'

He nodded sadly, saying nothing. He would not ride, no matter how large a horse she found. He walked along the chapel wall, steps heavy, running a finger along the bank of small, nested altars set into shallow alcoves within. Each featured a small statue of some household god or significant divinity, not that he'd have been able to recognise any of them. Despite whatever proclamations were made in public, the presence of the statues attested to Shirin's lasting affection for his mother's faith. His finger collected very little dust.

'You know,' Loveless said, turning back from the disc, 'you could do with a bit of sprucing up yourself, old boy. We want to make a good impression.' Her lips stretched into a mischievous smile. 'Maybe he'll take a shine to you instead. He's quite the dreamboat, as I'm sure you well know.'

Foss coughed and turned away from her, embarrassed, pretending to inspect the ashes of an offering in one of the crucibles. With his back to her, he smoothed down the rumples on the front of his jacket, then cocked a foot, checking for mud splashes on his boots. He then muttered a soft prayer to the merciful Shepherd, and made the sign of the crook in miniature with one hand where Loveless couldn't see.

The door to the chapel swung open, and a liveried spearman, boar-sigil proud across his chest, entered and stood to attention beside it. A seneschal followed, a strong-boned, attractive woman of middle years with a pronounced limp, ledger beneath one arm. She looked them up and down, one eye squinting.

'His lordship will be right with you, but he must see to his banquet guests first. Your timing is unfortunate in that regard.'

Loveless took a calculated step, and Foss found himself at her elbow, as if her own minder. He sniffed but made no comment. He should have expected as much.

'Our gracious thanks,' Loveless said, her accent suddenly pronounced, her words sounding like someone else's. 'We apologise for the necessity of our visit, but it could not wait.'

The seneschal nodded, noted something in her ledger and left. The guard followed, pulling the door shut behind him.

'Really playing up the accent, eh?'

'What? He needs to think we're exotic dignitaries from afar on secret missions of state, or at least that I am.' She flashed him a dazzling grin. 'You're just my muscle.'

'You may be the most shameless person I've ever met.'

'Aw, come on, Foss-bot!' She gave him a playful smack on the arm. 'Don't tell me you've never wanted to pretend to be someone else, if only for an evening.'

He turned back to the alcoves to hide the sharpness of his reaction, staring at a small, half-illuminated statue that was half-snake, half-woman, until the memories faded and his breathing calmed. The years weighed upon his shoulders like towers of lead. Further torment was averted by the rattle of the door. It swung inwards once more, and before the guard could settle into position a whirlwind of a man burst past.

'My lady! I came as soon as I could.'

He was tall, for a man with half-Shenakar blood, not close to Foss, of course, but he probably had an inch on the Chel boy. His heritage was obvious, his hair still thick and wavy, albeit thronged with silver, his handsome face and sparkling eyes lined but strong. He was clad in silk and wore a long, curved sword at his hip, odd for a man hosting guests at his own estate, the expected Shenakar ceremonial dagger strapped at his belt. He was flushed, pupils dilated, either half-cut or in a state of great excitement. Foss considered that it might be both.

Loveless bowed, the glittering blue stone dropping away as she bent, a shimmering beacon to her cleavage. Foss inclined his head, feeling absurd and grubby and uncomfortable.

'My gracious lord,' she said, matching his archaic form of address in her overwrought accent. 'You may call me Sinama. I cannot say who we represent, only that our mission is grave, and that you may be the only man who can save us all.'

Shirin's eyes widened, and his mouth formed an O of excitement. He drew close, conspiratorial, trying to control his anticipatory grin. His gaze continued to drop as he did so, which Loveless seemed to mind not at all.

'Whatever it is I can provide, it is yours. I could never refuse an entreaty from my friends to the n—'

Loveless raised her eyebrows and put a lascivious finger to her lips, stilling him.

'…Of course, of course, _whoever_ may need me.'

She rewarded his correction with a beaming smile, placing one hand on his arm. Foss rolled his eyes, disguising his grunt of disgust as clearing his throat.

Shirin looked up at him.

'I say, I know you, don't I?'

Foss froze, as Shirin nudged Loveless. 'Your man here, I've seen him before, haven't I?'

Loveless was staring at him too, eyes narrow. 'That seems… unlikely.'

'It was out east, years ago, easily a decade, maybe fifteen. I was touring then, lending assistance as it was required—you know me.'

Loveless flashed a flattering grin, but her eyes returned to Foss, sharp and urgent. _What does he know?_ Foss's mind was racing, bouncing through a personal history best left undisturbed. He was sweating in his new jacket.

'You were king of the pit, weren't you? In Marichan. We stayed to watch the whole tournament, quite incredible stuff. Missed the battle of Metten as a result, which didn't go down too well!' He shrugged in mock apology, then slapped Foss on the arm. 'I must say, I've never seen a man, before or since, with such command of the environment. Stellar stuff. Obviously, we've all put on a bit of timber over the years—' He patted his belly, which remained utterly flat. '—but you've made an excellent pick here, my lady. This man is a born champion.'

Loveless was still staring at him, but her expression had become one of mirthful surprise, tinged, perhaps, with a slice of admiration. Foss was still sweating, far too warm in his jacket, but for once his skin prickled with unfamiliar pride.

'Thank you, my lord.'

'What was it they called you? The Bridge… no, the Wall!'

'Back then, they did.'

'A title earned, good sir. I'm delighted to see you're doing well for yourself, Master Wall, with such a charming employer.'

Loveless drew Shirin back in with her smile, eyelashes fluttering, and wove tales around him of grave threats and conspiracy, the massing of foreign powers and agents of rebellion, and Shirin's own place at the heart of it all. She really didn't need to invent much. She impressed upon him old but unstated alliances, the need to move in secrecy, and the brilliance of requesting greater forces from his mother's kin in Shenak. Foss let her words roll over him, with Shirin's corresponding gasps and exclamations, and thought of a simpler, if not entirely happier time.

Their cloaks returned, Loveless paused at the chapel door, giving thick one last devastating look over her shoulder, cementing her control over him.

'You will remember, my lord, to tell no-one of this?'

'Of course. My oath is yours.'

'And you will stay your hand, keep your forces hidden, until the moment is right? Until the traitors have passed, and their lines are strung across your borders?'

'I will, may all the gods save me. I will strike them like thunder!'

'Once they have passed, yes? Our thanks will be eternal, my lord. You will save us all.' She turned, nodding for Foss to follow. He did so with an unexpected pang of regret.

'Wait!'

Shirin bounded after them, his eyes shining in the candlelight, hopes, dreams and fantasies burning from within.

'Won't you stay for the party?'
