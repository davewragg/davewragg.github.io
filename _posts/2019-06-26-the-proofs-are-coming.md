In case you missed [this tweet](https://twitter.com/NatashaBardon/status/1143814668215042048), here's the news: proofs are coming, and next month.

A few printed and spiral-bound editions have been floating around over the past couple of weeks (I did my own proofreading with 200+ loose sheets of A4, and I was grateful), but for the first time there's going to be an actual, physical book-like object for the Black Hawks. If you want one, you need to be in Ms Bardon's good books* (which leaves me out); otherwise, may I direct you to the exclusive hardback editions linked on the [books](/books) page?

Books, eh? Bloody marvellous.
