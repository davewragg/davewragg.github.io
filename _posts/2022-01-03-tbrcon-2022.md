In case it's somehow not on your radar, we're now only a few weeks away from one of the most extraordinary virtual conventions ever assembled: **TBRCon 2022**, organised by FanFiAddict. The full (stellar) programme is available on the [con website](https://fanfiaddict.com/tbrcon-2022/), and I'd invite you to peruse it at your leisure, but the obvious standout item is the **Characterization in Fiction** panel, featuring a host of fantastic writers - and yours truly.

{% picture lazy /images/uploads/14.-tbrcon-characterization-1536x864.jpg --alt Characterization in Fiction, featuring Sammy K  Smith, Mike Carey, ML Spencer (moderator), Mike Chen and RJ Barker - and me! 27th Jan 1300EST/1800GMT --a class="image fit" %}

The panel is on 27th January at 1300 EST/1800 BST (other timezones are available), and should be a lot of fun - do drop by if you have the chance. Links and details of how to watch are all on the con website, along with the rest of the con programme - which is phenomenal.

See you there!
