## Over to you

That's about all I can do from here (although do check back now and again to see new content as it arrives). As and when you get to the book, I hope it delights you. And if you fancy leaving a review on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0008331448/) or [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50174451-the-righteous), you'll be keeping the machine turning just a little bit longer.
