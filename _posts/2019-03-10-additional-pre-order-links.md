On top of those marvellous ordering links for the Black Hawks already featured, I've now added some extras for international customers and those who like to shop around to the __[Books page](/books/)__. There seems to be some difference of opinion between the sites on both price and the precise release date, but "late Summer" appears to have it covered.

Suppose I'd better finish it before then.
