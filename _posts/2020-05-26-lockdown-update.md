## Hi

I've not been around on Twitter - my preferred Sphere of Social Interaction - very much, or active here, over the last few months. The reasons for this aren't dramatic, or even exceptional. I have two small children at home, a full-time job (which I'm lucky enough to be able to do remotely) and a number of Book Obligations on the go, and staying on top of What Must Be Done doesn't leave a lot of time for Other Things.

Despite all that, I have managed a couple of jolly outings:

## SRFC reading

[Super Relaxed Fantasy Club](https://twitter.com/SRFantasyClub) have been doing a stellar job on [their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH8uMELmpiOVLik40s8y5vA) of keeping the good book vibes going. I did my bit, whether they wanted me to or not, and chucked in an exclusive scene from the Black Hawks while looking a bit like someone who'd had his hair cut with a beard trimmer.

## MAYDAYCON!

I was honoured to be invited to take part in [David Walters aka FanFiAddict](https://twitter.com/DWalters29)'s virtual convention, [MAYDAYCON](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCObUCiZk90lu5sqDSZ3lJlg/videos), which streamed live last weekend. All the panels and readings are now up on the YouTube channel, and they're fantastic - I'd recommend your full attention for the lot. I was lucky enough to join the second panel of the day: "Grimdark, Grimheart, or just Low Fantasy? You decide."

## An author on a podcast, talking books

Sticking with the indefatigable Mr Walters, he was generous enough to invite me onto his podcast, [Authors on a Podcast Talking Books](https://anchor.fm/aoaptb). If you think you can handle 90 minutes of me gassing on about a swathe of almost-related topics, I would implore you to give it a listen.

## Where's book 2 then?

Yeah, this is the bad news. Given everything going on across the industry and the world in general, it won't surprise you that book 2 has been delayed. I'm afraid we're now looking at a six-month extension to April 2021. I'm obviously very disappointed - you can imagine I'm extremely keen to give you the next part of the Black Hawks' story. I will do my utmost to make it worth the wait.

## You rotter

Sorry.

## Do you at least have a title, or a cover to show?

Um, no. Sorry again. I hope, however, that some more upbeat news won't be long in coming. Please do stay tuned.

In the meantime, good health, clean hands and peaceful minds to you all.
