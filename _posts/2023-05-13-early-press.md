We've had a few bits and bobs around THE HUNTERS over the last few weeks, so I thought I'd corral them here for easy retrieval, plus some exciting news at the bottom.

## Features!

You'll no doubt have seen this, but Nils at the Fantasy Hive did a rather lovely [Cover reveal and Q&A](https://fantasy-hive.co.uk/2023/01/the-hunters-by-david-wragg-cover-reveal-and-qa/) back in January.

The Unseen Library were kind enough to feature The Hunters among their [anticipated releases](https://unseenlibrary.com/2023/02/15/waiting-on-wednesday-the-hunters-by-david-wragg/) for this year.

And I did a somewhat rambling Q&A for the esteemed and patient [Big Bearded Bookseller](http://www.bigbeardedbookseller.com/2023/04/28/david-wragg-qa/).

## Excerpts!

If you fancy reading a bit of the start of the book, FanFiAddict have hosted [the whole of Chapter One](https://fanfiaddict.com/excerpt-the-hunters-tales-of-the-plains-1-by-david-wragg/).

And if that wasn't enough, Civilian Reader also have a good chunk of [Chapter Three](https://civilianreader.com/2023/05/08/excerpt-the-hunters-by-david-wragg-harper-voyager/).

That ought to give you a decent flavour of what's in store.

## Exciting news!

Here it is: there _will_ be a Goldsboro special edition of The Hunters - details to follow. The listing isn't up yet but I'll put something out on the [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/gBvwHH) when I hear more.
