Deleted scenes are just that - those that didn't survive the edit for any number of reasons (pacing, length, dullness _cough_), and no longer fit in the book in question - the finished books are the finished books, and lack for nothing.

But if you want to know what might have been (and make your own judgement on its merits...), here are a few odds and sods for your perusal.

## The Righteous

> _The Righteous_ in its final form stuck with Chel's POV for the duration, but in the original draft we saw a number of scenes from the POV of other members of the Black Hawks. In the middle part of the book, with the group split up, our heroes attempted to find allies for their coming battle against the forces of the crown.

- [Rennic meets his old mentor](/deleted-scenes/rennic)

...And don't forget the [Floating Prologue](/blog/the-floating-prologue/) which can be applied to either _The Black Hawks_ or _The Righteous_ as you see fit.

## The Hunters
