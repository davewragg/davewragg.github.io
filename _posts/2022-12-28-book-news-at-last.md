## You may remember I promised an update

What can I say? Something about good things and waiting? Oh, we did that one already. Well, the waiting is finally over, and I can confirm that I have a new series on the way, titled **Tales of the Plains**. It will be a trilogy, set in the same world as Articles of Faith (about 13 years later) in the wild, untamed lands to the far north of the Serican Protectorate.

The first book will be **The Hunters**, and it's arriving in July 2023*. You can see the full cover on the [Books page](/books/tales-of-the-plains), or even click [here for a high-res version](/images/hunters-cover-large.jpg). We've gone colour on this one, and I think it looks pretty bloody spectacular indeed.

The blurb isn't yet finalised, so here's the two sentence summary:

> Ree is a woman with a past and a 12-year-old niece, Javani, living at the very fringe of the known world. When two sets of killers arrive in their remote mining town, intent on hunting the girl in her care, Ree must confront both new threats and old lies if she hopes to get them both out alive.

It will be followed by **Book 2** in 2024, and **Book 3** in 2025. All dates subject to the usual publishing vagaries, of course. (Please note that these are not the final titles, I am not actually allowed to call them that.)

As well as colour on the cover, we're also getting a hardback release this time, and collectors should keep an eye out for **a special edition or two** - more on that as soon as I have it.

More news will, inevitably, arrive in due course, but in the meantime you can find some extremely tempting pre-order links awaiting you on the [Books page](/books/tales-of-the-plains).

## Twexodus (of sorts)

I've been here and there on Twitter for the last couple of years - just between us, I used to find it a source of both amusement and illumination, but I don't think I've been alone in finding it, well, not-fun for a while now. Since the recent takeover, things have taken an even greater nosedive. To that end, I've set myself up on Mastodon - you can find me at <a href="https://{{site.mastodon.instance}}/{{site.mastodon.username}}" rel="nofollow" title="Mastodon">{{site.mastodon.username}}@{{site.mastodon.instance}}</a> - where I do actually engage with people! Madness, I know.

I won't be deleting the Twitter account, on the offchance that another change in ownership or management isn't too far off, so I'll still be responding to messages and notifications there where I can, and posting the odd update about the upcoming books, but I'll be minimising my presence otherwise.

If you want to make sure you don't miss a thing I have to say, this site has [an RSS feed](/feed.xml) (if you remember the olden days), otherwise there is, of course, [my mailing list](http://eepurl.com/gBvwHH). I promise to email you only if it's really, _really_ important. As ever, if you want to tell me anything, do pop a message in the contact form at the bottom of the page.

Be well, and best wishes for 2023.
