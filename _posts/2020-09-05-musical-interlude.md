Spectacular composer [Will Musser](http://www.willmusser.com/) is a fan of The Black Hawks, and has composed an absolutely thumping piece to accompany the book. You can have a listen on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOFhrkKeHro), or simply click the video below:

I advise sticking it on repeat and rereading your favourite scene from the book as an ideal pastime while we await that promised update on book 2...

Soon, promise. _Promise_.
