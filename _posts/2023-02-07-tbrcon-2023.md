Apologies for not posting in advance, but I was once again a part of one of the greatest virtual conventions out there, **TBRCon**, this time in its 2023 incarnation. I took part in the kick-off panel on **"Putting the 'Funny' in 'SFF'"**, alongside Sean Gibson, Quenby Olson, GM Nair and KRR Lockhaven.

Y﻿ou can see a replay of the panel below:

T﻿he rest of the convention programme was pretty spectacular - you can see find the full setlist on [the FanFiAddict site](https://fanfiaddict.com/tbrcon2023/), or check out [the playlist on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSRMtzayhbWzgKGtnsmnUgQVxMdpKB_bA) if you want to watch the whole lot in order. There are far worse ways to spend your time.

B﻿elieve me.
