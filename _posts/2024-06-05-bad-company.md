A﻿s revealed on [the Fantasy Hive this afternoon](https://fantasy-hive.co.uk/2024/06/the-company-of-the-wolf-by-david-wragg-cover-reveal/), the news (and cover) is out: book 2 of the Tales of the Plains is entitled **THE COMPANY OF THE WOLF**, and it will be released in hardback, ebook and audio on 29th August 2024.

T﻿he story follows Ree and Javani from The Hunters as they set out across the impassable Ashadi mountains in search of a new life, and instead find a hidden village off the beaten track. The villagers are welcoming, rich in produce and fertile land, but take their laws very seriously: peace at all times, weapons forbidden, violence anathema.

B﻿ut the villagers are not alone in the valley: a﻿ company of mercenaries lurks in the wooded hills, and they are hungry. And despite - possibly - making everything worse, only Ree and Javani stand a chance of averti﻿ng b﻿loody catastrophe.

D﻿espite being the second in the series, it's possible to read The Company of the Wolf completely standalone should you wish - although naturally I'd recommend purchasing and reading The Hunters several times beforehand. Both will be required to get the most from book 3, which should be with us in Summer 2025.

F﻿or now, prepare yourselves to meet The Company of the Wolf this August. Discover more, and find some pre-order links, on [the books page](/books/tales-of-the-plains#the-company-of-the-wolf-august-2024).
