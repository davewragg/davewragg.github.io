The moment has arrived. Book 2 has a title, a cover, and a confirmed release date. Please make way for **THE RIGHTEOUS**, arriving **10 June 2021**.

The blurb isn't saying much at this stage, but if you've finished the Black Hawks I can imagine you're _very keen_ to find out what happens next. Here are some hints:

- Breakneck escapes!
- New friends!
- Old enemies!
- Vice versa!
- Explosions!
- Political disagreements!
- Cold places!
- More explosions!
- Hot places!
- A nice bath!
- Impending doom!
- Fruit-based cocktails!

I think that should give you a flavour of things. Don't forget to get your preorders in early - you can find a bevy of links on the [Books page](/books). The cover art is by the stellar [Gavin Reece](https://meiklejohn.co.uk/artist/Gavin_Reece_ND).

## Trivia Time!

And as a little treat, here's some Black Hawks Trivia. **SPOILERS BELOW**, so please avert your delicate eyes if you're yet to finish Book 1.

### I got the names of both of my cats in the book

My cats are called Bonnie and Clyde (shh), but Bonnie is known as the Bear (because she is a miniature bear). Lemon's home, Clyden, is named after Clyde, and Chel is called "Bear" by his sister, amongst others. Watch out for more pet names in book 2.

### Lemon and Foss's travel banter is based on real office chat

I've worked with some wonderful people over the years (you know who you are), and Lemon and Foss's conversations were directly inspired by conversations in the workplace. So would you rather be a tarantula, or a hairess cat?

### The crown prince had a real-life inspiration

For the character of Tarfel's surviving brother, I was struck by the notion of someone who, to casual observers, affected a very jolly, posh and harmless countenance, masking something deeply sinister beneath. I wrote the first draft in 2015, and took inspiration from a political figure of the time, the then-mayor of London ... Boris Johnson.

Well I wasn't to know, was I?
