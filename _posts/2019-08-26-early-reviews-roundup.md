Earlier today I sent the manuscript for book 2 to my editor at HarperVoyager. This marks the start of the Editing Phase, which occupy the next few months and will, all being well, lead to a finished book by this time next year.

In the meantime, the release of book 1 is now only __one month away__, and we're already getting some early reviews from the Advanced Readers. The [books](/books) page already boasts a few choice quotes, but if you'd like to delve deeper, here's a selection:

Over on GoodReads, the magnificent __Anna Stephens__ called The Black Hawks _'a remarkably assured debut'_ in [her 4-star review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2862867305) (the very first to go up, thank you, Anna!).

__Ed McDonald__ went one better, [giving the book 5 stars](https://edmcdonaldwriting.com/2019/08/22/book-review-the-black-hawks-by-david-wragg/) in his review: _'A vibrant cast, intrigue and action come together in this blazing debut ... Iâ€™m going to label it WitPunk.'._

At [Grimdark magazine](https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-the-black-hawks-by-david-wragg/), reviewer __James Tivendale__ described the book as _'an extraordinary debut that is as humorous as it is dark. ... Wragg has a winner on his hands here. Highly recommended.'_

And finally, __Robin Carter__ at [Parmenion Books](https://parmenionbooks.wordpress.com/2019/08/09/david-wragg-black-hawks-review/) said: _'I loved the characters, no matter how dark and devious they got there was always something new about them, the story brought something new to the table which i think gets harder every year. ... Highly recommend this book, its great fun and really fast.'_

Thanks very much to all my reviewers, listed here and otherwise!
