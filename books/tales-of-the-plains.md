## The Hunters (July 2023)

**It's 13 years since the events of The Righteous, and the world is changed...**

Ree is a woman with a violent past – a past she is eager to put behind her. After years of wandering, she and her niece, Javani, have built a small farm in mining country, at the edge of the known world, and Ree is keeping her head down.

But one day two groups of professional killers arrive in town, looking for a young girl and a white-haired woman. A deadly chase through deserts, mountains, and mines begins. And Ree will have to discover her former self if she is to keep them both alive.

## The Company of the Wolf (August 2024)

**Full of David Wragg’s unique blend of humour, heart, and high stakes, The Company of the Wolf is the epic next instalment in the Tales of the Plains trilogy.**

Seeking a better life, Ree and Javani have travelled west into the mountains, and left their pasts - and their troubles - behind. But new places bring new problems, and when they stumble across a lone traveller under bandit attack, they make the mistake of lending a hand.

Forced to take refuge in the traveller's village, they quickly find allies among the lush, wooded hills. But then the true nature of the bandits is revealed.

With winter approaching and a vengeful company of mercenaries circling like wolves, Ree and Javani must uncover the secrets of this peaceful valley . . . or risk the ruin of it all.

### Praise for The Hunters

_'Wragg's witty, light-hearted style is once more put to excellent use here in the first of a new series, which bounces brilliantly from humour to pathos to tragedy to absurdity with just the right mix. Great characters, more secrets than you can shake a keg of blasting powder at, and a wonderfully-realised frontier town setting.'_  
Anna Stephens, author of the GODBLIND trilogy and SONGS OF THE DROWNED

_'Fast paced, hilarious and peppered with the sort of chaos I crave in a fantasy novel, The Hunters is also full of quiet emotional beats that keep you anchored to the characters and the story. You cannot help but have a great time reading this book.'_  
Jen Williams, author of THE POISON SONG, the COPPER CAT trilogy and TALONSISTER

_'Filled with outrageous dark humor and razor-sharp prose - it's just so much fun.'_
Sunyi Dean, Sunday Times Bestselling author of THE BOOK EATERS

_'The Hunters is packed to the brim with madness and mayhem, humour and anarchy, mysticism and alchemy, but most of all it holds characters you will absolutely love, and those you will love to hate ... Everything I expected and so much more — achingly heartfelt, addictively fast-paced and hilariously chaotic.'_  
Nils, THE FANTASY HIVE

_'The action in this book simply does not let up and is among the best I’ve ever read in fantasy ... I highly recommend this one for Grimdark Magazine readers and am very much looking forward to getting my hands Book 2.'_  
Sally, GRIMDARK MAGAZINE

_'David Wragg is one of the best storytellers out there right now ... The Hunters took me away, and I loved every minute of my adventure in this world ... This story has a vitality to it that isn't to be missed.'_  
Beth, THE FANTASY HIVE

_'With The Hunters, Wragg has ascended to top-tier fantasy status. More fun than a champagne mouthwash.'_  
Ed, FAN FI ADDICT

_'Fantastic start to the series. I've no idea where the next one could go but I'm 100% along for the ride, and yes, that pun is very much intended.'_  
Nina, THE FUSSY READER

_'The Hunters ... satisfied my western fantasy cravings in ways I can’t even describe.'_  
HOLLY HEARTS BOOKS

### Praise for The Company of the Wolf

_'Gritty, sharp, yet criminally funny!'_  
Sunyi Dean, Sunday Times Bestselling author of THE BOOK EATERS

_'Dave Wragg is one of my favourite writers because he is so bloody entertaining! The Company of the Wolf is no exception: it is full of whip-smart dialogue, brutal action and brilliant characters. It is barnstorming modern fantasy and not to be missed.'_  
Gareth Brown, Sunday Times Bestselling author of THE BOOK OF DOORS

_'Book 2 of the Tales of the Plains sees higher stakes, a bigger vista, a badder villain, a taller Javani, and even more classic Wragg one-liners. A fun-filled romp with a serious heart and a cast of loveable rogues.'_  
Anna Stephens, author of the GODBLIND trilogy and SONGS OF THE DROWNED

_'A tale full of heart: heart warming, wrenching and stopping in equal measure. I love Wragg's wild, western-inspired world and its rabble of humorously and sensitively crafted characters, the kind that keep you company long after reading.'_  
Cari Thomas, Sunday Times Bestselling author of THREADNEEDLE

_'A story about growing up, growing old, dreams, betrayal, greed and consequences, all wrapped up in a neat package of action and tied off with a perky bow of banter. I enjoyed hating the villain almost as much as I enjoyed rooting for Ree and Javani.'_  
Peter Newman, Gemmell Award-winning author of THE VAGRANT and THE DEATHLESS

_'Diamond wit, blade-sharp dialogue and a cast of characters so compelling I’d give my right hand to save them were they real… this is not just Wragg’s best book, but everything I adore about modern fantasy in one volume.'_  
Ed Crocker, author of Epic fantasy trilogy LIGHTFALL

_'Wragg's brand of fantasy deserves its own name: grassroots fantasy. Small in scale, large in heart, with underdog heroes you can't help but root for.'_  
Amber A. Logan, author of THE SECRET GARDEN OF YANAGI INN
