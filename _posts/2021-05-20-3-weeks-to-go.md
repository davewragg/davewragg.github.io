As I mentioned in my recent [mailout](https://mailchi.mp/1ea6b65c2256/one-month-to-the-righteous) (have you joined the [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/gBvwHH) yet?), we're getting very close to the release of **THE RIGHTEOUS**, and things are about to get a little promotion-heavy.

Coming up on the site in the next few weeks, you can expect to see:
- a **proper recap** of The Black Hawks, for those who'd like a more in-depth refresher
- a **floating prologue**, which you can print out and stick in front of **either book** for a little scene-setting flavour
- some top-secret **deleted scenes** from The Righteous, preserved (unedited) in amber for your morbid fascination
- serious danger of a **musical tribute** act
- ...and more!

There's bound to be a whole lot of nonsense on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsdavewragg) too, let's not kid ourselves otherwise.

Stay tuned!
