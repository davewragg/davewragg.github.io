## The Hunters (July 2023)

__It's 13 years since the events of The Righteous, and the world is changed...__

Ree is a woman with a violent past â€“ a past she is eager to put behind her. After years of wandering, she and her niece, Javani, have built a small farm in mining country, at the edge of the known world, and Ree is keeping her head down.

But one day two groups of professional killers arrive in town, looking for a young girl and an white-haired woman. A deadly chase through deserts, mountains, and mines begins. And Ree will have to discover her former self if she is to keep them both alive.
