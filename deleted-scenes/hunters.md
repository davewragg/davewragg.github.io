> In the original draft, Ree and Javani (and Javani's other friend Peri) encountered Aki and Anashe escaping from a prison at the town's edge. After hiding out in the hills overnight, they endeavored to reach the Guildhouse the following morning, where Ree hoped to find safety in the care of not-yet-dead Guildmaster Ferdous…

They were up before dawn, and watching the town gates from the red-backed ridge to the north. Downslope, Javani and Peri yawned and groused about the early start and disappointing state of breakfast. Peri added her refrain of her desire to go home.

The gates opened, and out rode an armoured delegation, raising a great cloud of dust into the streaked and burnished sky. At the head of the column were two figures in gilded armour, the rest in Guild armour.

'Here we go,' Ree murmured. 'They'll come out in force, split and look to pick up our trail from last night. Those two at the front, you know them?'

'Yes,' said Anashe from over her shoulder. 'They are the murderers of the boy.'

'Then let them ride far. By the time they work out we've circled back to town, we should be well inside the Guildhouse.'

Aki was laid out beside her, squinting beneath his hands. 'And they will leave the gates open and undefended?'

'Of course not, but I'm confident that whoever is left on duty will prove eminently charmable.' She tossed her head, more from habit than anything else, and the realisation sent a chill through her. I don't think I've done that in years.

'Who is that?' Anashe said, her voice a growl.

Ree squinted. 'Where? Your eyes are better than mine.'

'My sister's eyes are better than any. The only shame is what lies behind them.'

'Shut up, Aki. A rider has remained at the gate. He looks young and swaggering, although his pose suggests … desperation.'

'Ah, shit,' Ree muttered. 'Kurush. The thrice-damned fencepost has stayed at the gate.'

'What's going on?' Javani had climbed the slope, her voice carrying the full weight of adolescent boredom. 'Are we going to town or what?'

'We've hit a snag, kid. Kurush has stayed at the gate. I did not credit him with the wit to cover himself.'

'Then we go to the other gate. The Guild gate?'

Ree rolled and sat up. 'We'd need more than a kind word and a silver coin to get through there, not when the guards have ants in their pants about the breakout.'

'We could fight our way in?' Aki suggested.

'Unwise,' Ree replied. 'There are an awful lot of burly and aggressive people who work enforcement for the Guild who would otherwise be hanged or imprisoned somewhere. I do not wish to get on their bad side when we have only a crossbow between us.'

'Could we go back in the hole we left from yesterday?' Javani asked.

'Unlikely to be unsupervised.'

'Then what do we _do?_' Javani was hopping from foot to foot, her face flushed. 'We can't stay out here, the trackers will find us eventually! You said we could get into town and get to the Guildhouse, and then we'd be safe! You said I didn't need to worry! Well I'm beginning to worry, Ree, I'm beginning to worry that the people who killed my friend Moosh _in front of me_ yesterday are only a couple of hours away from doing the same to me. _What are we going to do?_'

Ree rubbed at the scar at her temple. 'Hush, kid, all you're doing now is giving me a headache.' She turned back to the town, her eyes tracing the scale of the outer walls, marking the occasional projection that rose above. There, at its centre, stood the Guildhouse, an edifice of yellow stone in a sea of mudbrick, its towers dotted with the pennant of the Guild and the newly installed wind-driver for Ferdous's gardens, turning lazily in the morning breeze.

Ree's eyes narrowed.

'Grab your gear. I have an idea.'

---

The sun sizzled in the clearing sky as they climbed the rise. It was getting hot. Ree cut a path through whispering grasses and sharp-pronged shrubs, eyes fixed ahead. Javani tried to keep up, but her aunt's pace was fierce and Javani felt weak and ill-rested. The dismal breakfast they'd enjoyed hadn't helped.

'Where are we going? We're heading away from town!'

Ree slowed her pace a notch, allowing Javani to catch up. She was sweating, strands of her gleaming white hair pressed to her scalp, shining tracks running down her scar, but she seemed burning with purpose. Behind them, Aki and Anashe were taking turns helping Peri up the slope. However tired Javani felt, the previous day had hit Peri far harder. She barely had energy left to plead to be allowed home.

'You know why Kazeraz is where it is?' Ree gestured behind them, to where the town sat nestled against the sweep of the terrain, its mudbrick walls bleached and pitted.

Javani bit her lip. She ought to know where Ree was going with this. 'Close to the mines, but still low enough for the caravans to reach easily?'

'But why _there_, specifically? Plenty of locations could meet those criteria.'

Javani sighed. 'I don't know, Ree. Can you tell me where we're going, or at least let us find some shade? I've drunk nearly all my water already.'

Ree stopped and raised a sharp eyebrow. Javani stopped alongside, grateful for the chance to rest her pack. 'I told you to ration it. But there's your answer.'

'What?'

'Water. As well as all those treasures the miners hack from the mountains, they're also full of water.' She pointed west, now, to where the red and rugged peaks surged skyward like the world's end. 'Snow-covered, all year round, even on the edge of a desert. This is the dry side, the other side of those peaks gets the run-off. That's why the coast beyond is rich and fertile, and we're stuck sucking stones in the summer months.'

'Ree? It's so hot…'

Aki, Anashe and Peri caught them up. 'Are we having a rest?' Aki asked. 'Not that I require—'

'No.'

Ree wiped her brow and resumed her climb, gesturing for the others to follow. With a sigh Javani shouldered her pack again, her back immediately swimming with sweat. Ree powered on, scanning the land ahead. 'There's still a lot of water on this side of the mountains, though,' she said, presumably to Javani who panted along in her wake. 'It's just underground.'

'So we dig wells?'

'We do. But wells have limits. Upslope farms and dwellings can draw water from them, but the further down you go the harder it is to get water. Without water, people die. And any kind of concentration of people needs feeding, too. Crops need water, animals need water.'

'I get it, water good. No water bad.'

Ree gave her a sharp look but one corner of her mouth curled upward. 'The nomads ranged over the expanse for generations before the protectorate expanded, but they don't farm. The animals eat the shitty grasses,' Ree cuffed an offending plant as they passed, 'and they live off the animals. Watering holes, sinks, the odd well, all good, but mostly they graze and they move.'

'But they aren't trying to dig stuff out of the ground, right?'

'Right. The acquisition of precious metals and gemstones is an undeveloped part of tribal culture, to say the least.'

Anashe came alongside, easily matching Ree's pace, Peri apparently left to her brother. 'I remain curious of this plan you mentioned,' she said with lightness that bordered on mocking. 'Not that the education of the young is discouraged.'

'The plan,' Ree said, her own breath finally beginning to catch, 'requires a measure of introduction. In the interests of minimising adverse reactions.'

'Now my curiosity burns like a wildfire,' Anashe said, her eyes overwide.

'What do you mean, adverse reactions?' Javani said, a slightly sick feeling rising within her.

'Let's skip ahead, I think we're nearly there.'

'Where?'

'We've established people need water, settlements need more, crops more still, yes?' Javani nodded, feeling the sweat running off her. Her lips tasted of salt. All this talk of water was not helping. 'And that the water on this side of the mountains can be deep underground.'

Another nod. Ree seemed to be walking faster, perhaps because they were close to their target, or perhaps because the sun had baked her mind. Javani had heard of travellers, lost in the desert and dying of thirst, who began to see visions, hear voices. Maybe Ree was just a few steps ahead of her. She blinked drips from her eyes, flicked her gaze from side to side in case a vision was sneaking up on her.

'So we dig canals, kid,' Ree said. 'Underground aqueducts. Drawing the water down from the hills, into town, out to the farms at the fringe.'

Anashe was still keeping easy pace. 'Who is we? This sounds an expensive and arduous activity.'

Ree smiled. 'Catastrophically.'

'Requiring skilled craftsmen and a long time period?'

'Undoubtedly.'

'Meaning those intending it would need abundant resources and an intention to invest, long-term, in a site.' Anashe was nodding, perhaps only to herself. 'And means to recoup that investment.'

'Enter the Chartered Miners' Guild of the Serican Protectorate. Find a potential site, throw up walls and towers and dig a water supply, you have a settlement. Proximity to the mines and local fortification makes for a regional centre for storage and transporting mine proceeds. Stabilise the trade routes to and fro … behold, a literal and figurative goldmine.'

'A lot of initial cost.'

'You know what they say, you need to have wealth to make wealth. Or is it "the first god's fortune is always the hardest"? I forget.'

Javani could feel the last of the water leaving her body, the final drops evaporating the instant they popped from her pores. 'Reeeeeee,' she pleaded.

'Nearly there, kid. You're clear on the plan now?'

Javani wanted to scream but she lacked the strength. 'No!' she croaked.

Ree frowned, her mouth pursed. 'You don't remember our time in Astarvan?'

'How old was I?'

Ree paused. 'I don't exactly recall. You demanded to be carried the whole time, but that does not narrow the timeframe.'

Javani scowled back. 'Then assume I don't remember.'

Anashe raised a palm. 'I, for one, am not aware of the particulars. Perhaps some refreshment might be in order.'

The use of the word refreshment gave Javani impure thoughts.

Ree pushed her way through a tall, dark-needled shrub stippled with pale pink flowers. The springing branches left oily streaks on Javani's arm. 'Some years ago, the kid and I spent some time down south in Astarvan. They were expanding their water system at the time, big project. We made friends with some of the engineers, a well-rewarded bunch. Gained some first-hand knowledge of how they're dug. Aha!'

Behind the shrubs was a raised mound of packed red rock, vaguely circular, with a woven grass cover across its top.

'Aha? Aha what?' Javani said, coming to a halt beside Ree. 'This looks like a well.'

'Or the output of a large burrowing creature,' Anashe added.

'Did you notice the large wind-driver that rises from the Guildhouse?' Ree said, moving to shift the cover from the mound. 'Guildmaster Ferdous has been splashing his skim on a paradise garden within the walls. A garden like that needs a lot of water. A direct line to the canal.'

'Wait,' Javani said, flicking drops of sweat from her fingers. At least there was a modicum of shade within the shrubs. 'There's a canal below the town?'

'There are several, and the Guildhouse sits on the biggest. The wind-driver will draw water up from the reservoir beneath, and saves on having to muck out an ox to do the same job.'

Anashe was staring at the now open hole at the mound's centre. It looked deep and very dark. 'And you are going to … send some sort of message to the Guildmaster using the canal? In a bottle?'

Ree set down the cover and stepped up to the mound. 'The construction of the canals requires access shafts spaced along their length as they descend, for airflow and maintenance.'

Javani gave her an uneasy look. 'Maintenance?'

Anashe was more direct, her nostrils almost as wide as her eyes. 'You wish us to leap into this darkness? Into the bowels of the earth?'

Ree fished one hand inside. 'There are steps cut into the side. And you don't have to come – once the kid and I are safe inside the Guildhouse you'll be surplus to requirements anyway.'

'Ree,' Javani said, her voice cracking, her eyes locked on the depthless void before them. 'You can't be serious. There has to be an alternative.'

Ree gazed back at her, her breathing even, entirely calm. 'We can sit out here and wait to cook, or be scooped up by that Shenakar bastard and his cronies. Those are alternatives. I'll go first if you like.'

Aki and Peri pushed through the shrubs to join them. Peri's hair was plastered to her as if she'd dunked her head in a bucket, and she was leaning heavily on Aki.

'What's this?' Aki said. 'What's the plan?'

'The woman wishes us to descend into this godless pit and traverse the water-choked veins beneath the earth to emerge somewhere within the stonewalls,' Anashe said with a tones of lead.

'Oh,' Peri said, her voice sing-song with fatigue. 'One of the canals runs beneath the ale house. We use it to keep the winter-ice whole in the cold-store. You could drop me off if you're passing.'

'Very well,' Aki said with a bright grin. 'Who is going first?'

---

'It's a lot cooler down here than I expected. I'm actually … cold.'

'Try not to step in the water. People have to drink that.'

'Does someone have a torch? It's so dark!'

'Is there even enough space to stand?'

'People came down here to dig it, people come down here to check it. You'll be fine. With any luck we won't bump into an inspection crew.'

'At least we'll see them coming.'

'What is that smell? Is the air down here poison?'

'Ah, my sister…'

'Aki! By the Goddess!'

'Which way do we go?'

'Down, kid. Always down.'

---

The tunnel took them miles in cool, splashing darkness. Javani walked with one hand on the rough, undulating wall, the air around her chill and moist, the infrequent shafts of scattered light from the vents they passed overhead their only measure of progress. Several times the tunnel branched; each time they took the widest passage.

Ree seemed to be leading them by instinct, forging ahead through sheer will. Javani wondered again about her aunt. Her 'aunt'. She'd vowed to demand answers when they awoke, but the chance had never come. Now they were wading through darkness towards or below the town, pursued by killers from across the sea and local toughs on the make, with a plan that went only as far as 'beg the Guildmaster for protection'. She wondered if the chance for answers would ever come.

She trawled her memories for the events Ree had mentioned, the tunnel-digging experiences in Astarvan. Her earliest memories were fractured things, a mass of strange, unconnected places and impressions of people. The only constant through it all was Ree, her single grounding through-line of personal history, of personal identity. Their lifestyle had been peripatetic long before she even knew the word (which was relatively recent, in fairness) and certainly long before she was aware of an alternative. They'd never stayed long in any one place, always living with one eye on the horizon, waiting for the time to come to move on again.

She'd made few friends; not that she wasn't gregarious, but that she kept her connections shallow by design. What was the point in discovering a soul-mate if you knew you'd be off with the next caravan that passed through?

Yet here, in Kazeraz, with Peri, with Moosh … it had felt different. She'd felt a sense of permanence at last, of groundedness, and that had come squarely from Ree whether she realised it or not. Perhaps it was that Ree herself had felt ready to settle, to anchor herself to a place for the first time in Javani's young life. Perhaps it was that from here there was nowhere else to go; impassable mountains to the west, impassable desert to the north, the rolling, impossible plains to the east, and to the south: their past.

And now it was all gone. The delicate little life they'd been building in this new place was over before it had even begun, dying with Moosh on the alley floor.

In the sloshing dark of the tunnels, Javani wept.

---

Peri was adamant: she would play no further part in the insanity that had enveloped them. Locating an outflow close to the ale-house took a couple of false starts, but Ree's single-mindedness brought them to a narrow vent beneath the cold-store, up which Peri was still just narrow enough herself to climb – with a bit of boosting and shoving. She embraced Javani before she went, whispered words of apology and sorrow and enduring, impossible friendship, then was gone, back to the ale-house, back to her mother. Back home.

This time Javani stifled her tears. The others were too close. Ree was watching her.

'Ready, kid? Then let's find the Guildhouse.'

---

'Here. Do you hear that?'

'I hear only water.'

'I thought you two were keen-sensed desert hunters?'

'My sister has the eyesight, my senses are more devoted to the sphere creative – that is, the—'

'Aki, we will not hear this mystery sound over the noise of your emission. Be silent.'

'For you, my sister, of course. Goddess forgive my imperfections.'

'… There?'

'There.'

'The wind-driver's pump?'

'Is that what you're calling your brother now?'

'I am greatly affronted by—'

'Hush, you brought it on yourself. Help me open the gate, the Guildhouse reservoir should be on the other side. A little unscheduled extra flow shouldn't cause any problems.'

'Can we ride the water-driver?'

'Wouldn't recommend it – a good way to lose fingers, I hear. There should be some stairs up from the reservoir though.'

'You know, these tunnels are a defensive disaster. What is the point of guards and walls of stone if one so minded can merely saunter beneath?'

'Your guess is as good as mine, Aki. I suspect that most of the town's inhabitants don't give too much thought to where their water comes from.'

'And for that, thank the Goddess.'

'Indeed.'

---

They emerged, half-sodden, into a dim and chilly room, and waded across a deep pool to a set of steps on the far side. In one corner creaked the slow-moving buckets of a pump, drawing water from the pool up through a gap in the tiled ceiling. Another darkened gap moaned with the passage of air.

'There's a windcatcher,' Javani said, starting towards it. 'I could climb up and see where we are.'

Ree put one hand on her shoulder. 'No need. Look at the tiles – nobody in town but the Guild could afford this level of detailing for mere water storage. And beyond that, what exactly would you know of climbing windcatchers?'

Javani met her pointed look with defiance. 'I guess we all have our secrets, don't we.'

Ree's expression didn't change. 'That we do. Come on, let's make our way upstairs. Carefully.'
